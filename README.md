## Dave Sant Group 4 Systems Modeling Spring 2019 Group 4 "Donut Giveup!"

This is really just Dave's method of sharing files using github because I think
this is easier for other people in the group to contribute to.

We probably won't have any real coding scripts here for this class, but this is
still effective and a good way for me to learn how to ust github. I am sure
they appreciate me playing around with their website for my own crap.
